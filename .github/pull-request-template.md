# PR Checklist (DO NOT CHECK IF YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DONE IT - YOU WILL BE FOUND OUT AND THE PR TROLL WILL GET YOU üëÅüëÉüëÅ)

- [ ] All lines committed are ones which I have deliberately changed (and I have checked this on the Files Changed tab of GitHub)
- [ ] My commits are broken down nicely into sensible chunks of work such that I could revert individual features
- [ ] The scope of my changes are confined to the scope of the ticket, or any scope creep has been signposted and ok'd off with the lead and/or product
- [ ] I have added unit/integration tests where appropriate (hint: it's almost always appropriate)
- [ ] I have not left commented out or debugging/testing code
- [ ] I have re-read through the ticket (including comments) and checked in the PR environment that this change does what the ticket asks for (following any reproduction steps for bugs and verifying that it is fixed, trying to break it)
- [ ] (Bugs only) There is a test which reproduces and then proves that the bug is fixed and has not regressed
